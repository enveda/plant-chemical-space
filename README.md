## Reproducibility

### Set up the environment (python)

Install requirements

```shell
python -m venv .venv && source ./.venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Rerun the notebooks

Run the notebooks located in the `notebooks` corresponding to each analysis. The prefix of the notebooks indicates the order in which is run, which also corresponds to the Results sections of the manuscript. For detailed information about each notebook, see the `README` inside the `notebooks` directory.

### Set up the environment (R)
To re-create the circular plot with heat-map, make sure to have **R v4.2.2** navigate to `notebooks/phylogenetic-viz` and run the notebook `color_figure_red_circle.R`. Please install the libraries listed at the top of the script using the command `install.packages("package_name")`

## Data

The manuscript is based on publictly available data from the following resources:
- [LOTUS](https://lotus.naturalproducts.net/) [1]
- [COCONUT](https://coconut.naturalproducts.net/) [2]

Datasets are publically available and can be directly downloaded from [![DOI]()]()

Furthermore, the directory `data` contains all the figures of the manuscript (generated by the notebooks) as well as tge raw and intermediary files (also generated by the notebooks).
